## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn to build an AI Tutoring System for Class 9 students. This tool automatically analyzes academic performance and delivers subject-specific feedback and study advice using AiCon V4. It’s great for helping students understand where they need improvement in Maths, Science, and English.

### What We'll Build

- A no-code workflow that gets triggered by a simple API call.
- It fetches student performance data from the WorqHat database.
- It uses AiCon V4 to generate tailored study suggestions.
- Sends feedback directly to the student's email address.

## Prerequisites

- WorqHat account ([sign up here](https://worqhat.com))
- Familiarity with using workflows and API keys
- Basic knowledge of AI prompting

## Step 1: Create a Database Table

1. Log in to your WorqHat workspace.
2. Go to **Database** > **New Table**
3. Name it `class9_marks` with these columns:
   - `documentId` (auto-generated)
   - `Name` (string, required)
   - `emailId` (string, required)
   - `maths_marks` (number, required)
   - `science_marks` (number, required)
   - `english_marks` (number, required)

## Step 2: Build the Workflow

1. Navigate to **Workflows** > **Create Workflow**
2. Name it `Class 9 AI Feedback System`
3. Set trigger type to "URL Based Request"

### Step 2.1: Fetch Student Data

- Add a **Fetch Data** node
- Choose `Fetch All Documents`
- Collection: `class9_marks`

### Step 2.2: Loop Through Students

- Add a **Loop Node**
- Set data source to the Fetch Data node’s output

### Step 2.2.1: Add Text Generation (Inside Loop)

- Model: `AiCon V4 Nano`
- Prompt:

  ```text
  You are a helpful AI tutor for Class 9. Given a student's marks, identify their weakest subject and provide 2-3 simple tips to improve. Encourage them with a positive message.

  Student Name: {{loop.item.Name}}
  Maths: {{loop.item.maths_marks}}
  Science: {{loop.item.science_marks}}
  English: {{loop.item.english_marks}}

  Response format:
  1. Weak subject(s):
  2. Improvement Tips:
  3. Encouragement message
  ```

- Output type: `Text`

### Step 2.2.2: Send Email (Inside Loop)

- To: `{{loop.item.emailId}}`
- From: `aitutor@yourdomain.com`
- Subject: "Your Personalized Study Advice - Class 9"
- Body: `{{text-generation-node.output}}`

### Step 2.3: Add Final Return Node

- Message: `Feedback emails sent to Class 9 students.`

## Step 3: Test Your Workflow

- Use the "Test" button
- Add some mock data to `class9_marks`
- Check that emails are received

## Step 4: Trigger It From Your App

Use your `API_KEY` and `WORKFLOW_ID` to call the workflow.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}'
```

Or JavaScript:

```js
await fetch(`https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({}),
});
```

Or Python:

```python
import requests
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
requests.post(
    'https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID',
    headers=headers,
    json={}
)
```

## Ideas for Extension

- Add support for more subjects
- Track students' progress monthly
- Notify parents via SMS
- Use charts to visualize performance

## Conclusion

You’ve built a fully functional, no-code AI tutoring system for Class 9 students. By combining WorqHat with LLMs, personalized education is now just a few clicks away.

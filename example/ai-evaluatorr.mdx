## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll build an AI Tutoring System tailored for Class 10 students, providing personalized feedback based on identified weak areas. This system analyzes student performance in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, generates targeted messages using an LLM, and delivers them via email, offering actionable insights to improve learning outcomes.

### What We'll Build

- A system triggered by an API request to process student marks.
- Logic to fetch student data and generate personalized tutoring messages using AiCon V4, focusing on areas of weakness.
- Automated email delivery of AI-generated feedback with specific improvement suggestions.

## Prerequisites

- A WorqHat account (sign up at [worqhat.com](https://worqhat.com))
- Basic understanding of API requests
- Familiarity with LLM prompting concepts (a plus)

## Step 1: Create a Database Table

1. Sign in to your WorqHat account and navigate to your workspace.
2. Go to the **Database** section.
3. Create a new table called `marks` with the following columns:
   - `documentId` (auto-generated, primary key)
   - `Name` (string, not nullable)
   - `emailId` (string, not nullable)
   - `maths_marks` (number, not nullable)
   - `physics_marks` (number, not nullable)
   - `chemistry_marks` (number, not nullable)

## Step 2: Create the Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** section and click "Create Workflow."
2. Name your workflow "AI Tutoring Feedback Class 10".
3. Choose "URL based request" as the trigger.

### Step 2.1: Fetch Data from Database

1. Add a **Fetch Data** action.
2. Configure it to retrieve all student records:
   - Select Action Type to Fetch All Documents.
   - Collection Name to `marks`.

### Step 2.2: Add a Loop action

1. Set the loop variable to the data fetched from the "Fetch Data" node. This will ensure the loop iterates through each student record.

### Step 2.2.1: Add a Text Generation Node (Inside the Loop)

This is where the magic happens! We'll use AiCon V4 to generate personalized feedback.

1. Set the model type to `AiCon V4 Nano` (or your preferred AiCon model).
2. **Prompt:** This is the core of the system. Craft a prompt that instructs the LLM on how to analyze the marks, identify weak areas, and provide helpful advice tailored for Class 10 students. Here's an example:

   ```text
   You are a helpful and encouraging AI tutor specializing in Class 10 subjects (Maths, Physics, and Chemistry). Your task is to analyze a student's marks, identify their weakest subject(s), and provide personalized feedback to help them improve.

   Here's the student's data:
   - Name: {{loop.item.Name}}
   - Maths Marks: {{loop.item.maths_marks}}
   - Physics Marks: {{loop.item.physics_marks}}
   - Chemistry Marks: {{loop.item.chemistry_marks}}

   Based on their performance, provide the following:
   1. Identify the subject(s) where the student needs the most improvement.
   2.  For each identified weak subject, provide 2-3 specific and actionable suggestions for improvement.  These should include study techniques, relevant online resources (Khan Academy, etc.), practice problems, or conceptual explanations. Focus on Class 10 level content.
   3.  Offer an encouraging message to motivate them, reminding them of the importance of consistent effort and a growth mindset.

   Keep the response concise and easy to understand for a Class 10 student. Focus on actionable advice the student can use immediately.
   ```

1. **Training Data:** Provide a few examples of input (student marks) and desired output (AI feedback) to guide the LLM. This drastically improves the quality of the generated text. Focus on the typical challenges faced by Class 10 students.

   ```text
   Input:
   Name: Alice
   Maths Marks: 75
   Physics Marks: 60
   Chemistry Marks: 80
   Output:
   Alice, it looks like Physics is an area where you could use some extra help. Class 10 Physics can be challenging! Try these tips:
   - Review the fundamental concepts of motion and forces. Khan Academy has great videos on this.
   - Practice solving numerical problems related to electricity and magnetism.
   - Consider forming a study group with classmates to discuss and clarify concepts.
   You're doing well in Maths and Chemistry, keep up the great work! With focused effort, you can improve your Physics score too!

   Input:
   Name: Bob
   Maths Marks: 65
   Physics Marks: 85
   Chemistry Marks: 55
   Output:
   Bob, Chemistry seems to be your area for focus. Here's how you can improve:
   - Make sure you have a strong grasp of the periodic table and chemical bonding.
   - Practice balancing chemical equations.
   - Use online simulations to visualize chemical reactions.
   Your Physics performance is good. Maths needs some work too - dedicate more time to practice algebra and geometry. Remember, consistent effort is key to success!

2. Change the Output Type to `Text`. We want a plain text message for the email body.

### Step 2.2.2: Add a Mail Node (Inside the Loop)

1. Configure the "Send Email" action:
   - From: `aitutor@yourdomain.com` (Use a valid "From" address)
   - To: `{{loop.item.emailId}}` (This dynamically inserts the student's email)
   - Subject: "Personalized Feedback from your AI Tutor - Class 10"
   - Body: `{{text-generation-node.output}}` (This inserts the AI-generated feedback)

### Step 2.3: Add a Return Node (Outside the Loop)

1. Add a "Return" action after the loop completes. This signifies the successful completion of the workflow.
2. Return a simple message, such as "AI Tutoring Feedback Sent to Class 10 Students"

## Step 3: Test the Workflow

1. Click the "Test" button in the workflow editor.
2. In the test panel, you can either create a test entry directly in the 'marks' database or send sample data via the API endpoint. Ensure your test data has a valid email address so you can verify the email sending.
3. Toggle on "Developer Mode" to see detailed execution steps
4. Click "Run Test" and verify that emails are sent and data is processed correctly.

## Step 4: Integrate with Your Application

### Create an API Key

1. Navigate to API Keys in your WorqHat dashboard
2. Create a new API key
3. Whitelist the domains that will be calling your workflow

### Frontend Integration

Here are code snippets demonstrating how to trigger the workflow from your application. Remember to replace `YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual values. The examples assume you are sending an empty JSON payload, as the workflow fetches data directly from the database. If you prefer to send student data via the API, you will need to modify the workflow to accept those parameters and adjust the code snippets accordingly.

&lt;CodeGroup&gt;

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}'
```

```javascript
async function triggerTutoringWorkflow() {
  const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const workflowId = "YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID";
  const url = `https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/${workflowId}`;

  const headers = {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  };

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({}), // Empty payload, fetching from DB
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("Workflow triggered successfully:", data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to trigger workflow:", error);
  }
}

triggerTutoringWorkflow();
```

```python
import requests
import json

workflow_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID'
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = f'https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/{workflow_id}'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

payload = {}  # Empty payload, fetching from DB

try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    data = response.json()
    print('Workflow triggered successfully:', data)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
    print('HTTP Error:', errh)
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
    print('Connection Error:', errc)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
    print('Timeout Error:', errt)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print('Request Error:', err)
```

&lt;/CodeGroup&gt;

## Important Notes

### Security

- Always whitelist domains that will be calling your workflow.
- Use API keys with appropriate permissions.

### Scalability

WorqHat workflows are designed for scalability.

## Extending the System

You can extend this system in many ways:

1. **Subject-Specific LLMs:** Use different AiCon models trained specifically for Maths, Physics, or Chemistry to provide even more specialized feedback aligned with the Class 10 syllabus.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Incorporate sentiment analysis to tailor the tone of the feedback (e.g., more encouraging for struggling students).
3. **Actionable Item Tracking:** Track which students acted on the suggestions and measure their improvement over time.
4. **Parent Notifications:** Add an option to send a summary of the feedback to parents.
5. **Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS):** Directly integrate with platforms like Moodle or Canvas to automatically trigger the workflow and update student records.
6. **Difficulty-Based Recommendations**: Provide different study materials based on the student's current understanding level.

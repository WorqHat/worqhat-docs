## What is the Alpha Model

Here's a closer look at how AiCon Alpha operates:
* **Foundation on AiCon v3 Models:** AiCon Alpha extends the capabilities of our AiCon v3 models, leveraging their advanced architecture to deliver enhanced performance and understanding.
* **In-house Search Technology:** We've developed a proprietary search, indexing, and crawling infrastructure that allows AiCon Alpha to access the most relevant and current information. Our search index is expansive, regularly updated, and employs advanced ranking algorithms to highlight high-quality, authentic content. This ensures that AiCon Alpha can offer responses enriched with the latest data, thanks to website excerpts or "snippets" drawn directly from our search results.
* **Fine-tuning for Real-time Relevance:** The AiCon Alpha models undergo rigorous fine-tuning, utilizing carefully selected, high-quality training sets prepared by our in-house data specialists. This process is aimed at optimizing the models' performance across various metrics, including accuracy, relevance, and timeliness. Regular updates and fine-tuning sessions ensure that AiCon Alpha remains at the forefront of AI-driven, internet-aware response generation.

By integrating these elements, AiCon Alpha stands out as a dynamic, internet-aware model capable of addressing queries with up-to-the-minute accuracy, such as recent event outcomes or the latest developments in a given field. This positions AiCon Alpha as a cutting-edge tool for accessing and leveraging internet-based knowledge.

Fine-tuning is a critical aspect of our alpha models, enabling them to effectively utilize snippets to inform their responses. Through the meticulous curation of high-quality, diverse, and extensive training sets by our in-house data contractors, we aim to achieve superior performance across various metrics such as helpfulness, factuality, and freshness. Our commitment to excellence involves regular fine-tuning of our models to ensure continuous enhancement of their performance.

## Generate from Text-Only Input
WorqHat AiCon V4 API allows you to generate text using only text input. You can choose from a variety of models, each with its own strengths:

* `aicon-v4-alpha-160824`: A better version of the `aion-v4-nano-160824` model which is trained on live data, providing up-to-date insights and knowledge. It's ideal for tasks that require real-time information, such as news analysis, market research, or staying informed on current events

**Choose Your Response Style:**

You have the option to either stream the response (`stream_data = true`) or wait for the entire result to be generated (`stream_data = false`).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Streaming">
    **Benefit:** Faster interactions. You receive partial results as they are generated, allowing you to start working with the text immediately.
    <br />
    **Example:**
    ```
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "question": "Your input prompt",
   "model": "aicon-v4-alpha-160824",
   "randomness": 0.5,
   "stream_data": true,
   "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
   "response_type": "text",
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Without Streaming">
  **Benefit:** You receive the complete generated text in one go. Suitable for situations where you want to handle output generated
  <br />
  **Example:**
  ```
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "question": "Your input prompt",
   "model": "aicon-v4-alpha-160824",
   "randomness": 0.5,
   "stream_data": false,
   "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
   "response_type": "text",
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
 ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

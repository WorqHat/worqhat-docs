## How does it work?
The Search V3 API uses advanced techniques to provide accurate and relevant search results. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. Understanding User Queries: The API understands the meaning and context of user queries by analyzing the uploaded data and extracting important information. It comprehends concepts and relationships within the text.
2. Numeric Representation: The API converts the uploaded data and user queries into numerical representations. These representations capture the meaning of the text in a mathematical format.
3. Similarity Calculation: The API calculates how similar the uploaded data is to the user's query using a similarity measure. It determines how closely the data matches the query.
4. Ranking and Retrieval: Based on the similarity calculation, the API ranks and retrieves the most relevant results. It identifies the data that closely matches the user's query, even if the exact question is not in the database.

<Warning>
**Info:** With the Search V3, it is still necessary for the user to provide the data to be searched. The Search V3 will find the closest possible match to the user's query from the provided data. It is not a content generation model and will not generate content on its own.
</Warning>

## Train Your Own Data

The Search V3 AI is a large model that is trained on a large dataset to understand the meanings of word and to understand how words relate with each other.

However, this model is mostly focused on Optimising Time and give quicker responses based on the meaning of what the
user has asked. That is why, this model is completely dependent on the training data provided by the user. The more training data you provide, the better the model will perform and return a better response on search queries.

<Note>
This model does not generate content on its own, but it is capable of understanding the meaning of the content provided by the user. It also understands and provides priority scoring to data that you have uploaded previously to the API. This means that if you have uploaded data to the API, and you search for a query that is similar to the data you have uploaded previously, the API will return the data that you have uploaded previously as the top result. It will also return other relevant results that are similar to the question you have asked.

PLEASE PROVIDE ACCURATE AND RELEVANT TRAINING DATA TO GET THE BEST RESULTS AS IT IS NOT A GENERATIVE MODEL.

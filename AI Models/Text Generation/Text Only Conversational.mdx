## Generate from Text-Only Input

WorqHat AiCon V4 API allows you to generate text using only text input. You can choose from a variety of models, each with its own strengths:
* `aicon-v4-nano-160824` **(finetuned included):** Ideal for quick and efficient text generation, especially when resources are limited.
* `aicon-v4-large-160824` **(finetuned included):** Our smartest and highest accuracy model, suitable for a wide range of text generation tasks, complex thoughts and reasoning along with mathematical solutions.
* `aicon-v4-alpha-160824`: A better version of the `aion-v4-nano-160824` model which is trained on live data, providing up-to-date insights and knowledge. It's ideal for tasks that require real-time information, such as news analysis, market research, or staying informed on current events

**Choose Your Response Style:**

You have the option to either stream the response (`stream_data = true`) or wait for the entire result to be generated (`stream_data = false`).

  <Tab title="Streaming">
    **Benefit:** Faster interactions. You receive partial results as they are generated, allowing you to start working with the text immediately.
    <br />
    **Example:**
    ```
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
    myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
    myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");
    var raw = JSON.stringify
    ({
        "question": "Your input prompt",
        "model": "aicon-v4-nano-160824",
        "randomness": 0.5,
        "stream_data": true,
        "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
        "response_type": "text",
    });
    var requestOptions = 
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: myHeaders,
        body: raw,
        redirect: 'follow'
    };
    fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Without Streaming">
  **Benefit:** You receive the complete generated text in one go. Suitable for situations where you want to handle output generated
  <br />
  **Example:**
  ```
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
    myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
    myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");
    var raw = JSON.stringify
    ({
        "question": "Your input prompt",
        "model": "aicon-v4-nano-160824",
        "randomness": 0.5,
        "stream_data": false,
        "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
        "response_type": "text",
    });
    var requestOptions = 
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: myHeaders,
        body: raw,
        redirect: 'follow'
    };
    fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
 ```

**Key Points:**
* Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual WorqHat AiCon V4 API key.
* Adjust the `model` parameter to select the desired model.
* Modify the `prompt` to provide your text input.

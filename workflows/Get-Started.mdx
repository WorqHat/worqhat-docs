title: 🚀 Getting Started with WorqHat Workflows
description: Welcome to WorqHat Workflows! This guide will walk you through the process of creating, configuring, and launching your first automated workflow — no coding experience required.

import { Alert } from "components/Alert";

---

## 📝 Step 1: Login and Access Workflows

1. Go to [worqhat.app](https://worqhat.app)
2. Login to your **organization account**.
3. Navigate to **"Workflows"** from the **dashboard** or **sidebar**.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Create a New Workflow

1. Click on **"Create Workflow"**.
2. You’ll be redirected to the **Workflows Page**, where all your workflows are listed.
3. Click on **"Create New"** — this opens a modal asking for the **workflow name**.

---

## ⚡ Step 3: Choose a Trigger

![Triggers](/images/triggers.png)

A **Trigger** is how your workflow is started. Select one of the following:

### ✅ Supported Trigger Types:

- **URL-based**: Start the workflow by making an HTTP request to a provided URL.
- **File-based**: Similar to URL-based, but allows uploading a file with the request.
- **Time-based**: Works like a cron job. Trigger it at regular intervals (seconds, minutes, hours).
- **Email-based**: Send an email to a unique address to trigger the workflow.
- **WhatsApp-based**: A message sent to a specific WhatsApp number will start the workflow.

---

## ✍️ Step 4: Describe Your Workflow (Optional)

![AiAissist](/images/aiassist.png)
You’ll now see an optional modal to **describe your workflow**, which helps WorqHat’s AI assistant generate the first draft:

### 🧠 AI Description Fields:

- **Given**: e.g., “an Image, a Text Document, etc.”
- **I want to**: e.g., “detect faces, analyze sentiment, etc.”
- **And return**: e.g., “the detected objects, the analysis results, etc.”

You can also add:

- **Additional Instructions** (Optional)
- **Reference Image** (Optional)

<Alert title="Tip">
  You can skip this step if you want to build the workflow manually.
</Alert>

## 🎨 Step 5: Canvas — Build Your Workflow

![workflow canvas](/images/workflow.png)
Whether you used the AI or not, you’ll be taken to the **Workflow Canvas**:

- Use the **right-hand sidebar** to **drag and drop nodes**.
- Connect nodes in the desired flow.
- Click on a node to configure it and use variables via the **`{}`** button in node settings.

---

## 🔧 Step 6: Configure Docs and API Access

1. Click on the **“Docs”** button (next to Analytics).
2. WorqHat will provide:
   - Suggested **API Key**
   - Your **workflow endpoint**
3. Click on **"Generate Document"** for code examples in:
   - Python
   - Node.js
   - cURL
   - and more...

<Alert title="New to APIs?">
  Use the generated code snippets to call your workflow without needing to write
  code from scratch.
</Alert>

---

## ✅ Step 7: Activate and Save Your Workflow

- Switch the status from **🔴 Red (Inactive)** to **🟢 Green (Active)**.
- Click **“Save Changes”** to preserve your work.

---

## 🧪 Step 8: Test Your Workflow

Use the built-in **"Test Flow"** button to test your workflow — no website or Postman required.

---

## 📦 Variables and Storage

You can define **variables** in your workflow to store and reuse information between steps — just like memory cells in a program.

These are extremely helpful when:

- You want to pass values (like user input or file content) from one node to another.
- You need conditional branching or custom logic.
- You want to reduce hardcoding and make your workflows dynamic.

### 🔧 How to Access Variables

Use the **`{}`** button inside any node’s input field to reference a variable.

### 💡 Example: Setting a Limit

Suppose you're checking whether a submitted number exceeds a **limit of 50**.

1. **Variable Node**  
   Set a variable called `limit` with value: 50

2. **Condition Node**  
   Use an expression like: inputNumber > limit

3. **Message Node (If True)**  
   Message: The value exceeds the limit of limit.

This keeps your workflow clean, reusable, and easily adjustable later.

<Alert title="Tip">
  Use variables to avoid hardcoding values like limits, API keys, thresholds, or
  dynamic messages.
</Alert>

## 📊 Analytics

- Click on **"Analytics"** to see logs and performance metrics of your workflow.

```js
// Example: Trigger a URL-based Workflow using fetch
fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/flows/trigger/FlowId", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer Token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "Your input text here",
  }),
})
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });

# *Supported File Types*

## This document is your guide to understanding and utilizing WorqHat AiCon's powerful multimodal capabilities. We'll break down the supported input formats, best practices, and limitations to help you get the most out of your interactions with our AI.


## *Images: Bringing Visual Context to Your Prompts*

### WorqHat AiCon can understand and process images, adding a whole new dimension to your prompts.

### *Supported Image Types:*
- *PNG (image/png)*:
 The go-to format for lossless image compression, perfect for crisp graphics and detailed visuals.

 - *JPEG (image/jpeg)*:
A widely used format known for its efficient compression, ideal for photographs and images with smooth gradients.


### *Limits*
- *Image Count*:
You can include up to 100 images in a single request.
- *Image Size*:
 There's no limit on the size of individual images, so feel free to use high-resolution visuals.

 ### *Tokenization*

 - *Image Representation*:
 Each image is represented by 290 tokens, assuming a square image of 500 x 500 pixels. This helps the AI understand the visual information within the image.

 ### *Best Practices for Image Input:*

 ### - *High Resolution is Key*
Use high-resolution images for the best results. The more detail the AI can see, the better it can understand your prompt.

### - *Provide Examples*
Include a few example images in your prompt to give the AI a clear understanding of what you're looking for.

### - *Proper Orientation*
Rotate images to their correct orientation before sending them to the API. This ensures the AI interprets the image correctly.

### - *Avoid Blurry Images*
Blurry images can make it difficult for the AI to understand the content.

### - *Indexing for Multiple Images*
If you're using multiple images, assign each one an index (e.g., `image 1`, `image 2`). This makes it easier to refer to specific images within your prompt and response.

## Limitations:

### - Content Moderation
WorqHat AiCon adheres to strict safety policies. The AI will refuse to process images that violate these policies.

### -Spatial Reasoning
While the AI can understand the general content of an image, it's not precise at locating specific text or objects. It may only provide approximate counts.

### -Medical Images
The AI is not designed for interpreting medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans) or providing medical advice.

### -People Recognition
The AI is not meant for identifying individuals in images unless they are celebrities.

### -Accuracy with Low-Quality Images
The AI may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or extremely low-resolution images. It may also struggle with handwritten text in images.

## *Videos: Bringing Motion and Sound to Your Prompts*
WorqHat AiCon can also understand and process videos, allowing you to incorporate dynamic content into your prompts.

### *Supported Video Types*
- **FLV (video/x-flv)**: Popular for streaming video, often used for online content.
- **MOV (video/mov)**: Known for high quality and support for various codecs.
- **MPEG (video/mpeg)**: Offers good quality with reasonable file size.
- **MPEGPS (video/mpegps)**: Designed for streaming video over networks.
- **MPG (video/mpg)**: Common format used for DVDs.
- **MP4 (video/mp4)**: Versatile format supporting both video and audio.
- **WEBM (video/webm)**: Optimized for web browsing with efficient compression.
- **WMV (video/wmv)**: Developed by Microsoft, often used for Windows-based media.
- **3GPP (video/3gpp)**: Designed for mobile devices, commonly used for smartphone videos.

### *Limits*
- **Video Count**: Up to 4 videos in a single request.
- **Video Size**: No limit on individual video size.

### *Tokenization*
- **Frame Representation**: Each frame in a video is represented by 100 tokens.
- **Frame Duration**: One frame is considered to be 1 to 3 seconds long.

### *Best Practices for Video Input*
- **Timestamp Format**: Use MM:SS format (e.g., 01:23) to specify moments within the video.
- **Consistent Timestamp Format**: Use the same format for all timestamp-related questions.

### *Limitations*
- **Content Moderation**: The AI adheres to strict safety policies and will not process violating videos.
- **Non-Speech Sound Recognition**: The AI may struggle with recognizing non-speech sounds.
- **High-Speed Motion**: The AI may have difficulty interpreting high-speed motion due to a fixed 1 fps sampling rate.
- **Transcription Punctuation**: The AI may return transcriptions without punctuation.

## *Audio: Adding Sound to Your Prompts*
WorqHat AiCon can also understand and process audio, allowing you to incorporate sound into your prompts.

### Supported Audio Types
- **AAC (audio/aac)**: High-quality compression for music and podcasts.
- **FLAC (audio/flac)**: Lossless format with high fidelity.
- **MP3 (audio/mp3)**: Balances quality and file size.
- **MPA (audio/m4a)**: Common format for Apple devices.
- **MPEG (audio/mpeg)**: Provides good quality at a reasonable file size.
- **MPGA (audio/mpga)**: MP3-encoded audio files.
- **MP4 (audio/mp4)**: Supports both audio and video.
- **OPUS (audio/opus)**: Optimized for internet calls and streaming.
- **PCM (audio/pcm)**: Raw audio format representing digital samples.
- **WAV (audio/wav)**: Uncompressed high-fidelity format.
- **WEBM (audio/webm)**: Optimized for web browsing with efficient compression.

### *Limitations*
- **Non-Speech Sound Recognition**: The AI may struggle with recognizing non-speech sounds.
- **Audio-Only Timestamps**: The AI cannot accurately generate timestamps for standalone audio files but can do so if paired with video.
- **Transcription Punctuation**: The AI may return transcriptions without punctuation.

## *PDFs: Working with Documents*
WorqHat AiCon can also understand and process PDFs, allowing you to incorporate documents into your prompts.

### Limits
- **Page Count**: PDFs can contain up to 250 pages.
- **Tokenization**: Each PDF page is counted as 290 tokens.

### *Best Practices for PDF Input*
- **Splitting Long Documents**: Consider splitting large PDFs to improve processing time.
- **Text-Based PDFs**: Use PDFs with rendered text rather than scanned images to ensure machine readability.

### *Limitations*
- **Spatial Reasoning**: The AI may not precisely locate text or objects and can only provide approximate counts.
- **Handwritten Text**: The AI may struggle with interpreting handwritten text in PDFs.

## Supported File Format

This is how the server expects the file to be sent when you are sending a file. The file inputs need to be sent as an array of multiple files.

```json

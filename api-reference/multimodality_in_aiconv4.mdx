# *Multimodality in AiCon V4*

### AiCon V4 models are designed to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. They are multimodal, meaning they can process information from multiple sources, including images, videos, and text. This allows them to grasp the context of a situation more fully, leading to more accurate and insightful responses.

### *Here's what makes AiCon V4 truly exceptional:*


### -Vast Contextual Understanding: With a token window of 750K tokens and a 90% recall rate, AiCon V4 can remember and process a massive amount of information. But that's not all. Our advanced retrieval mechanism effectively expands the context window to near-infinite capacity, ensuring that your conversations are always grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand.

### -Conversation First Design: We believe in making AI interactions seamless. That's why AiCon V4 automatically keeps track of your past conversations, eliminating the need for you to constantly re-explain yourself. This allows you to focus on the conversation, not the technicalities.

### How to improve this design to market it

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", gap: "20px" }}>
  <Image 
    src="worqhat-docs\api-reference\endpoint\image.png" 
    alt="Design Example" 
    width={400} 
    height={250} 
    style={{ borderRadius: "8px", flexShrink: 0 }} 
  />
  
  <div>
    <p>To improve the design for marketing purposes, consider these aspects:</p>



### Visual Appeal:  
- **Color Palette:** Choose colors that evoke trust, professionalism, and care, such as calming blues, greens, and whites.  
- **Lighting:** Ensure the image is well-lit to highlight details and create a welcoming atmosphere.  
- **Composition:** Use a balanced layout to draw the viewer’s eye to key elements like the beds, staff, and technology.  
- **Details:** Add realistic details like medical equipment, plants, and artwork to create a more immersive experience.  
- **Perspective:** Play with perspective to make the image more dynamic and interesting.  

### Marketing Considerations:  
- **Target Audience:** Who are you marketing to? Tailor the design to appeal to your target audience, whether it’s patients, doctors, or investors.  
- **Messaging:** What message do you want to convey? Use the design to highlight your key selling points, such as quality care, advanced technology, or compassionate staff.  
- **Call to Action:** Include a clear call to action to encourage viewers to learn more, book an appointment, or visit your website.  
- **Brand Consistency:** Ensure the design aligns with your brand’s visual identity.  

Remember, a good design should be both visually appealing and informative, conveying your brand’s message effectively to your target audience.

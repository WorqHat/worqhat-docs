**Generate from Text-Only Input**
* `aicon-v4-nano-160824` **(finetuned included)** : Ideal for quick and efficient text generation, especially when resources are limited.
* `aicon-v4-large-160824` **(finetuned included)** : Our smartest and highest accuracy model, suitable for a wide range of text generation tasks, complex thoughts and reasoning along with mathematical solutions.
* `aicon-v4-alpha-160824`: A better version of the aion-v4-nano-160824 model which is trained on live data, providing up-to-date insights and knowledge. It's ideal for tasks that require real-time information, such as news analysis, market research, or staying informed on current events.

**Choose Your Response Style:**

You have the option to either stream the response (`stream_data = true`) or wait for the entire result to be generated (`stream_data = false`).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Streaming">
    **Benefit:** Faster interactions. You receive partial results as they are generated, allowing you to start working with the text immediately.
    <br />
    **Example:**
    ```js
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "question": "Your input prompt",
   "model": "aicon-v4-nano-160824",
   "randomness": 0.5,
   "stream_data": true,
   "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
   "response_type": "text",
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Without Streaming">
  **Benefit:** You receive the complete generated text in one go. Suitable for situations where you want to handle output generated
  <br />
  **Example:**
  ```js
   var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer sk-02e44d********");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "question": "Your input prompt",
   "model": "aicon-v4-nano-160824",
   "randomness": 0.5,
   "stream_data": false,
   "training_data": "Add your training data or system messages",
   "response_type": "text",
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v4", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
  ```

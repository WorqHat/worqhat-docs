## Detecting and Analysing Faces with AI

Detecting and Analysing Faces with AI using ImageCon V2
ImageCon V2 by WorqHat AI offers robust face analysis capabilities for images and videos. With ImageCon V2, you can detect faces within an image, and obtain valuable information about those faces. This includes the location of detected faces, facial landmarks such as the position of eyes, and attributes such as emotions (e.g., happiness or sadness) and the presence of glasses or face occlusion.

By submitting an image containing a face to ImageCon V2, the system will detect and analyze the facial attributes present. It provides a confidence score indicating the likelihood of a face being detected, along with detailed information about the facial attributes identified in the image.

Additionally, ImageCon V2 enables face-to-face comparison by allowing you to compare a face in one image with faces detected in another image. This feature can be useful for applications such as identity verification or searching for similar faces in a database.

ImageCon V2 by WorqHat AI empowers users to perform comprehensive face analysis, extracting key facial attributes and facilitating face-to-face comparisons. These capabilities have broad applications across industries, including security, identity verification, image search, and more.

How does it work?
ImageCon V2 by WorqHat AI provides face analysis capabilities where it returns an object for each detected face, containing information such as the bounding box, facial landmarks, quality, and pose along-with predictions for gender, age, emotion, face occlusion, and more, with
corresponding confidence scores.

It's important to note that gender binary predictions made by ImageCon V2, based on physical appearance, should not be used to determine a person's gender identity. Similarly, emotion predictions are based on facial expressions and may not reflect an individual's actual internal emotional state. It is not recommended to make decisions impacting rights, privacy, or access to services solely based on these predictions.

To ensure accuracy in classification, it is advisable to use a threshold of 99% or higher, particularly when negative impacts could arise from wrong classification. However, for Age Range, ImageCon V2 estimates lower and upper age bounds, with wider ranges indicating lower confidence. Approximating the mid-point of the range can be used as a single value for age estimation.

One valuable use of these attributes is generating aggregate statistics. For instance, attributes like Smile, Pose, and Sharpness can be utilized to automatically select the "best profile picture" in a social media application. Additionally, anonymized demographic estimation based on predicted gender and age attributes can be employed for broader sample analysis, such as at events or retail stores.

<Note>

The face detection models used by ImageCon V2 are trained on real-world images of human faces. As a result, they may not support the detection of faces in cartoon/animated characters or non-human entities.

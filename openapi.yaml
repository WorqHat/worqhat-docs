                  description: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with all AiCon V4 models.Setting to { `"response_type":` `"json"` } will enable the model to send back structured outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema in the message. `Important:` when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via the training_data or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly `"stuck"` request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason=`"DONE"`, which indicates the generation exceeded maximum tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length and you will be billed for the whitespace.

To let the model maintain a history of your conversations by default, you can pass the conversation id. You can define a conversation id on your own or you can just use the conversation id that is returned as a response in the first conversation itself. Since you will be dealing with files here, we don't allow you to pass a conversation history on your own.

                    An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with all AiCon V4 models.Setting to { "response_type": "json" } will enable the model to send back structured outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema in the message. Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via the training_data or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="DONE", which indicates the generation exceeded maximum tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length and you will be billed for the whitespace.

                    Every interaction with the Language Model is associated with a Conversation Id. To let the model maintain a history of your conversations by default, you can pass the conversation id. You can define a conversation id on your own or you can just use the conversation id that is returned as a response in the first conversation itself. Since you will be dealing with files here, we don't allow you to pass a conversation history on your own.
